# Viewport and Viewboxes

## Viewport:

The area of that is visible to the user is called the viewport.

i.e

`<svg width="100px" height="100px"> </svg>`

So the viewport of the svg here is a 100 x 100 px area.

``Image shown in file "SVG_Viewport"``

## Viewbox

This will decide where the viewport starts. 

viewbox is an attribute of the svg tag.
The attribute has 4 properties:

`viewBox = " x_start y_start height width "`

if you increase the height and width of the of veiwBox , the svg zooms out.
If you decrease , the svg zooms in

## Use an editor like Inkscape

You can use editors like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape to create and modify SVGs. A link to a tutorial on Adobe 
Illustrator is given below:
